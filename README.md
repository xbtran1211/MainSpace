# Data Science / Analytics Portfolio
Hey there, this is the official Github workspace of Xuan Bach Tran. You can call me Bach :)

About me:
+ I am a fresh graduate from Western Sydney University with degrees in Applied Finance and Applied Data Science.
+ Currently working as a risk analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia (PwC).
+ I only discovered my curiosity for data and programming in my third year at university and still learning to be a better data analyst everyday.
